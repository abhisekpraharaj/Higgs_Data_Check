# Higgs_Data_Check
In this repository I have added 2 files containing the background and signal counts of the Higgs background and Signal Data. We will go through the data, TFile, TTree and branches to draw the histograms of these data files and analyse the dataset.
The background, signal and bandg hists contains background data, signal data and comparision of background and signal data respectively.

The Higgs_signal.root and Higgs_background.root are the data files for background and signal values.
The bbr stands for the code to draw background branches and number in bbr like bbr_0 ,it shows are the branch numbers.
The br stands for the code to draw signal branches and number in br like br_0, it shows are the branch numbers.
The r0.c stands for the code to draw the comparision of background and signal histogram for specific branches represented by the number shown with it like r0.c is the code for the first branch. 

The bgread.c and sgread.c are codes to read the background and signal data, whereas the inspectionsg and inspectionbg are the codes to inspect the background and signal have any data inside it or not.
