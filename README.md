# Higgs_Data_Check
In this repository I have added 2 files containing the background and signal counts of the Higgs background and Signal Data. We will go through the data, TFile, TTree and branches to draw the histograms of these data files and analyse the dataset.
The background, signal and bandg hists contains background data, signal data and comparision of background and signal data respectively.
